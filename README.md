This project built on ubuntu 14.04, depending on opencv-2.4.x. If your environment are linux and you opencv was
installded under /usr/local. You can use make in the root directory to build this project. There will be one excutable
file in directory bin.

    bin/align  show the effection, usage: ./align [image list] [out dir]

    bin/align_model.dat the align model 
    bin/detect_model.dat the detect model 

## Method
The algorithm in this project to detect face is 3000fps in [1].
